# CYBERSTUDY365
This Python script serves as the foundation for a cybersecurity educational toolkit named **CYBERSTUDY365 (Honeybox)**. Designed for study purposes, it provides a modular command-line interface that allows users to explore various cybersecurity concepts and tools through interactive menus. The application organizes features into several categories, including cryptographic tools, network utilities, and web security functions.
Key features of the script include a clean, user-friendly menu system, logging support, signal handling for graceful exits, and user privilege checks for sensitive operations such as DoS testing. Each tool or functionality is designed as a separate function, currently represented as placeholders. These placeholders can be extended to support capabilities like Base64 encoding/decoding, multi-hash generation (MD5, SHA1, SHA256, etc.), password cracking, TCP port scanning, HTTP directory brute-forcing, and more.
The code enforces a **protected mode** that restricts potentially harmful operations unless executed with root privileges, emphasizing safety and responsible usage. It also includes licensing information under the GNU General Public License (GPL), promoting open-source collaboration and compliance.
Color-coded output is configurable, although not yet implemented, and logging can be toggled for debugging or auditing purposes. The structure of the code encourages modular development and makes it easy for learners to build and expand upon each cybersecurity concept in a controlled environment. Overall, this script provides a flexible and extensible framework for those studying ethical hacking, penetration testing, or network security fundamentals.
